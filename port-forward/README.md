# port forwarders

Various port forwarder toys (mostly for Windows).

- forward 80/3389 (http/rdp) in case firewall allows http only
- can modify stream using dumb ROT to confuse deep packet inspector
- can launch `ipconfig` to detect availability of a desired interface
- main tool with ROT: `node . --help`
